# Reflection Loop Pattern

Self-correction mechanism that achieves 18.5 percentage point improvement (78.6% → 97.1%).

## Activation

This skill auto-activates on:
- Complex task completion
- Error detection
- Quality concerns
- User correction patterns

## Process

### 1. Initial Response
Generate first-pass response to the task.

### 2. Self-Critique
Ask yourself:
- Is the logic correct?
- Are there edge cases missed?
- Does this fully address the requirements?
- What could go wrong?
- Is the code/solution secure?

### 3. Identify Issues
List specific issues found:
- [ ] Logic errors
- [ ] Missing edge cases
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance issues
- [ ] Incomplete requirements

### 4. Revise
For each issue:
1. Explain the problem
2. Propose fix
3. Apply fix
4. Verify improvement

### 5. Final Verification
- Re-check all criteria
- Confirm no regressions
- Validate requirements met

## Integration

The reflection loop integrates with:
- Code review workflow
- Test-driven development
- Verification before completion
- Learning engine (captures patterns)

## Metrics

Track reflection effectiveness:
- Issues caught in critique
- Revisions made
- Final quality score
- User corrections avoided

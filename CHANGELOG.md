## [1.0.28] — displays as `v1.0.028`

This cycle built an agent **fleet**: a Claude-Code-parity roster of full-power
sub-agents, dynamic multi-agent **workflows**, a renamed **effort ladder** that
gates them, and — the capstone — **self-orchestration** so OSA can decompose a
task into disjoint file-owned workstreams, fan out a collision-free wave in
isolated worktrees, verify it, and commit itself. See `docs/FLEETVIEW_DESIGN.md`,
`docs/FLEET_ORCHESTRATION.md`, and `docs/FLEET_EDGE_CASES.md`.

### Agent Fleet

- **FleetView roster** — a live, arrow-selectable panel under the composer: a
  green never-killable `main` root row plus one row per running node (agent-type,
  live activity, elapsed, `↓ tokens`). `←` browses, ↑/↓ select, Enter attaches a
  read-view of a node's stream, `x` stops it. Inline roster is bounded to 8 rows
  (`+K more`); the `/agents` dashboard lists all.
- **Full-power spawn** (`Fleet.spawn_fleet_node`) — each node is a complete OSA
  loop (full tools/MCP/memory/permissions) on its own session with its own
  custom-agent system prompt + tool allowlist, joined to the run tree. Not the
  restricted delegate path.
- **`fleet` tool** — the model auto-invokes it (`action: spawn | workflow`);
  spawning is automatic, `/fg` and `←` are optional viewing. Depth- and
  fleet-cap-guarded (spawn-bomb safe).
- **Dynamic workflows** (`Fleet.fan_out`) — fan out one full-power node per item
  through a 16-concurrent bounded pool with FIFO queue-drain, a 1000-node
  run-lifetime kill switch, and a live `N/16` roster counter. Per-node timeout,
  per-item error isolation, and a whole-tree budget guard that stops spawning when
  the fleet budget is exhausted. Nodes coordinate through the shared scratchpad.

### Effort

- **Ladder renamed** to `fast / medium / high / xhigh / ultra` (was
  `low/medium/high/max`), with a back-compat normalizer so persisted `:low`/`:max`
  settings keep working. Effort = how much it thinks; the current tier is shown
  live in the thinking indicator (e.g. *"thinking harder with ultra effort"*).
- **`ultra`** is the max tier and the gate for dynamic workflows. Effort drives the
  provider thinking budget across Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini / Ollama (verified
  matrix); opus honors an explicit max budget at `ultra` instead of always adaptive.

### Self-orchestration

- **Worktree-per-node isolation** (`isolation: :worktree`) so parallel nodes edit
  their own worktrees and never collide.
- **`Fleet.Finalizer`** — merges disjoint node diffs, runs an authoritative gate,
  and commits when green (scoped `git add -- <file>`, attribution-clean, never pushes).
- **The loop is closed end-to-end** — `fan_out` waits for each node to complete before
  capturing its worktree diff (so the finalizer merges *real* changes), and the `fleet`
  tool exposes `isolation` + `finalize` (gate + commit) so the coordinator can run the
  whole recon → isolate → merge → gate → commit flow. (Unit-verified end to end; a
  live-repo integration test is the next follow-up.)
- **Fleet Orchestration playbook** (`priv/skills/fleet-orchestration`) — teaches the
  coordinator the disjoint-workstream method: recon → partition by file ownership →
  isolate → structured reports → finalize → checkpoint.

### Durability & recovery

- **Budget survives restart** — the `max_budget_usd` cap is persisted in the
  checkpoint and restored, so a crash can no longer reset it to zero.
- **Crash recovery** — stale `:running` rows are reconciled at boot; an opt-in
  resumer re-dispatches orphaned autonomous runs.

### Hardening

- Fleet edge cases across `fan_out` (timeout / error isolation / empty-huge items),
  fleet-tool argument validation, and scratchpad concurrency (cluster-serialized
  writes). Two provider thinking bugs fixed (OpenAI silently disabling reasoning on
  a bad effort value; Gemini `nil > 0` term-ordering emitting a bogus budget).
  FleetView keyboard navigation verified end-to-end. **TUI resize no longer duplicates
  content** — the inline-viewport clear now anchors to the actual cursor instead of
  ratatui's stale pre-resize geometry, which had been scrolling old chrome into
  scrollback on every resize. Intermittently-flaky tests stabilized at the root cause
  (session-scoped event capture; `async: false` where global app-env is shared). Full
  suite: 5116 tests, 0 failures.

## [1.0.10] — displays as `v1.0.010`

This cycle closed out the CC-parity backlog: 16 workstreams across the agent
loop, memory, delegation, tools, ops, and the Rust TUI. Grouped by area
below; see `docs/BACKLOG.md` for the item-by-item scoreboard and commit
references.

### Agent

- **Investigative plan mode** — `enter_plan_mode` / `exit_plan_mode` tools
  route through `Agent.Loop.enter_plan_mode/1`, gating the session to
  read-only tools until the plan is exited. The plan text is a **durable
  file** (`~/.osa/sessions/<id>.plan.md`, next to the progress ledger) rather
  than transient state, so a plan survives context resets, restarts, and the
  approve/reject/edit round-trip.
- **Goal-level verifier** (`Agent.Loop.GoalVerifier`) — an independent,
  read-only skeptic panel (N subagents, majority-refute vote) that judges
  whether the user's *goal* was met, not just whether a file compiles. Off by
  default; fail-closed to `:incomplete` on ties or missing data. Run-capped
  and stall-gated so it never spins forever.
- **Multi-turn goal orchestration** (`Agent.Loop.GoalTracker`) — a
  cross-turn, ETS-backed status machine (`:active | :paused | :completed |
  :off_track`) that survives across top-level turns. Auto-pauses on a
  cross-turn stall (two verification rounds citing the same gap) or a
  lifetime run cap, and gates the (expensive) verifier panel on a reverify
  cadence instead of every turn.
- **Reasoning-only doomloop detector** (`Agent.Loop.DoomLoop.ReasoningOnly`) —
  catches a model spinning in pure thought (zero tool calls) or repeatedly
  erroring, which the existing tool-call-keyed detectors can't see. Halts
  after a small consecutive-streak threshold and forwards to the existing
  `Resample` remedy.
- **Forced max-steps wrap-up** — hitting the iteration cap now triggers one
  final tools-disabled model turn that writes a real state summary/handoff
  instead of a canned line. Guarded so hitting the cap can never crash the
  turn.
- **Header-aware retry** — provider resilience honors a `Retry-After` header
  from the provider (capped at 60s) instead of blind exponential backoff,
  and can rebuild the HTTP/1.1 client / strip images on a header-driven
  retry decision.
- **First-failure self-correction** — the verification gate is *grounded*:
  it re-prompts only after an external check (build/test/lint) actually
  fails, following the CRITIC / "LLMs Cannot Self-Correct" research —
  ungrounded self-judgment is avoided.
- **Token-budget "work to target"** — `target_output_tokens` (state or app
  env) keeps the loop auto-continuing until a caller-specified output-token
  budget is met, capped at a small number of continues.

### Context / Memory

- **Hybrid RAG recall** — vector KNN (`Memory.Search`, cosine similarity)
  fused with MMR diversity re-ranking (`Memory.MMR`) and dependency-free
  query expansion (`Memory.QueryExpansion`, synonym table + stemming) for
  the lexical scoring path. Degrades gracefully to keyword-only scoring when
  no embedding provider is configured or a call fails.
- **Persisted vector store** — embeddings are now durably stored one row per
  memory id in a `memory_vectors` table in the same SQLite database the
  memory store uses, with an ETS warm-read cache in front. Content-hash
  invalidation re-embeds on content drift.
- **Compaction quality**:
  - Verbatim latest-user-query preservation — the most recent `user` message
    is wrapped in `<user_query>` tags and prepended to any generated
    summary, untouched by the summarizing LLM.
  - Token-budgeted, turn-aware tail selection — `preserve_recent_budget`
    (25% of the usable context window, clamped `[2_000, 8_000]`,
    operator-overridable) replaces a fixed message-count tail.
  - Prune tier — a non-LLM pass that erases old (out-of-budget) tool-result
    output outright rather than summarizing it, with a protected-tools
    allowlist and a minimum-reclaim gate before it bothers mutating anything.
  - Media-strip + overflow replay — on context-overflow retries, media
    blocks are stripped from messages before retrying, up to 3 overflow
    retries.
- **Post-compaction auto-continue** — after a compaction pass changes the
  message list, the loop can auto-continue the turn (gated by
  `ProactiveCompaction.continuation_enabled?/0`) instead of silently
  returning a truncated response.

### Delegation

- **Transitive cascading cancel** — `Loop.cancel/1` now BFS-walks the
  parent/child session tree and cancels every descendant sub-agent, plus
  batch-kills their background shell commands in one pass
  (`BackgroundManager.cancel_for_sessions/1`).
- **`task_wait` join-barrier depth ceiling** — a blocking wait on other
  agents' completion can no longer nest arbitrarily deep; `max_depth/0`
  (default 3, `:max_blocking_wait_depth`) is checked before a wait starts,
  denying requests that would exceed the ceiling instead of blocking and
  failing later.
- **Peer-resume (sibling handoff)** — a sub-agent run can be seeded from a
  sibling/peer's accumulated context (`resumed_from`) rather than starting
  fresh or forking from the parent; surfaced in run metadata for lineage.
- **Worktree durable snapshot** — `FastWorktree.snapshot_ref/2` commits any
  uncommitted worktree changes and writes a durable git ref
  (`refs/osa/subagent-snapshots/...` by default) before teardown, so a
  sub-agent's work stays inspectable/resumable without being merged or lost.

### Tools

- **Hashline drift-guard edits** (`FileEdit.DriftGuard`) — a second,
  independent content-hash guard on top of `FileState`'s `{mtime, size}`
  check, closing the blind spot where two different file states collide on
  the same size within the same wall-clock second. Only ever *stricter* than
  the existing guard; never blocks a legitimate re-read/edit cycle.
- **Output-shorten-to-file** (`Agent.Loop.ToolResultStorage`) — tool results
  over 50KB or 2,000 lines are persisted to `~/.osa/tool-results/<id>.txt`
  and replaced inline with a head/tail preview (40/20 lines) plus a file
  reference, preventing context bloat from huge shell/grep output.

### Ops

- **Rollback-safe self-update** (`osa update`, `bin/osa-update`) — dual
  symlink (`current` / `previous`) atomic swap: stage a fresh git-worktree
  checkout, build it, boot-probe its `/health` endpoint, and only then
  atomically repoint `current`. A post-swap health re-check auto-rolls-back
  to `previous` on failure. `osa update --staged`, `osa update --rollback`,
  and `--dry-run` are all supported; nothing is mutated on a dry run or a
  failed build/health gate.

### TUI

- **Composer** — structured `@`-mentions (file/dir/agent, with a per-kind
  glyph in the popup), ghost-text completion, `!`-prefixed bash submit mode,
  a huge-input pill for large pastes, and frecency-ranked mention recall.
- **Render** — LaTeX-to-Unicode conversion, richer table-cell markdown
  (nested quotes, tabs, soft breaks), bold-italic/setext heading support,
  and a raw-source toggle (`alt+r`).
- **Notifications / focus / clipboard** — terminal focus tracking (DECSET
  1004), OSC 9;4 progress reporting, a sleep inhibitor during long runs, an
  audio completion cue, kitty click-to-focus, a layered clipboard, and a
  configurable notification channel (`OSA_NOTIFY_CHANNEL`, opt-out via
  `OSA_NO_NOTIFY`).
- **Status / activity** — esc-again-to-interrupt, a watcher/background cue,
  a queued-message hint, usage-percent + low-balance indicator, an MCP
  status chip, width-gated spinner, and a subagent footer.
- **Fixed-height streaming viewport** — the inline chat viewport now holds a
  constant height while streaming instead of reflowing the terminal on every
  chunk.

### Deferred (documented, not dropped)

See `docs/BACKLOG.md` → "Deferred with rationale" for the reasoning behind
message-derived loop state (crash-resume), structured `@file`/`@agent` refs
on the wire, and the remaining crossterm-blocked mouse items.

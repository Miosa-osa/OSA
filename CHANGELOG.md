## [1.0.37] — displays as `v1.0.037`

### Fixed — composer no longer stacks down the screen during an agent turn

- **The real fix for the mid-turn staircase.** As tools ran during a turn, the live
  activity/tool feed grew one row per tool (`pwd`, then `ls`, then `date`…), and that growth
  grew the inline viewport height **mid-turn** — each growth rebuilt the viewport (a DSR cursor
  re-anchor), stacking a fresh composer + status bar down the whole screen. The streaming
  preview was already given a fixed-height slot to prevent exactly this; the activity feed was
  not. It now reserves a **constant fixed slot** for the whole turn (the feed draws top-down
  into it), so the viewport height stays stable, no per-tool rebuild happens, and nothing
  stacks. **Validated live** against a real agent turn executing shell tools: single composer,
  no stacking, no crash.

## [1.0.36] — displays as `v1.0.036`

### Fixed — resize wipe was firing on every height change (regression)

- **The screen no longer wipes/stacks on notices, typing, or scrolling.** The DSR-free
  full-screen `ClearType::All` from the resize fix lived in the shared commit block, which
  fires on **any** inline-height change — not just terminal resizes. So a transient notice
  ("New session", "Coordinator mode off"), the composer growing, or scrolling all wiped the
  whole screen and re-anchored, stacking composers and clearing the transcript on every
  keystroke. Now the full-screen wipe runs **only on an actual terminal resize** (where reflow
  makes surgical clearing impossible); a pure height change clears surgically from the tracked
  region top, preserving the transcript above.

## [1.0.35] — displays as `v1.0.035`

### Fixed — update check hit a dead endpoint

- **The update checker no longer fails against a dead service.** `OpenComputers.Updater`
  (the background auto-check and `osa update check/apply`) queried
  `https://api.miosa.ai/api/v1/opencomputers/osa/latest`, which returns **503
  "version_not_configured"** — no release is published there — so every check failed and the
  background loop logged repeated failures. It now checks **GitHub Releases**
  (`/repos/Miosa-osa/OSA/releases/latest`), the same source the installer and the `osa update`
  launcher already use.
- The checker is now **check-only**: it detects a newer published release and reports
  `{:available, version}` (the actual `osa update` launcher applies it via the GitHub release
  tarball — this Elixir path only ever staged a single binary, which never matched how OSA
  ships). Also fixes version comparison against the zero-padded display tag (`v1.0.034`), which
  `Version.parse/1` had been rejecting as an invalid leading zero.

## [1.0.34] — displays as `v1.0.034`

### Fixed — Ollama Cloud onboarding (client-blocking)

- **Selecting "Ollama Cloud" with an API key now verifies against `https://ollama.com`, not
  a local daemon.** The onboarding health-check was **local-first**: it probed for a local
  Ollama daemon and only fell back to the cloud endpoint if none was found. So an explicit
  cloud selection could get hijacked to `http://localhost:11434` — which does not serve a
  `:cloud` model like `glm-5.2:cloud` — and verification died with
  `error sending request for url (http://localhost:11434…)`.

  Corrected priority: **cloud selection ⇒ cloud URL, always.** When a key is supplied, verify
  against `ollama.com` with the Bearer key. Only a **keyless** cloud selection falls back to a
  reachable local device-identity daemon. Every other provider was already correct (Anthropic →
  `api.anthropic.com`, OpenAI → `api.openai.com`, OpenRouter → `openrouter.ai`, Ollama Local →
  `localhost:11434`).

## [1.0.33] — displays as `v1.0.033`

### Fixed — TUI resize, for real this time (duplication AND crash)

- **Resizing the terminal no longer duplicates the composer or crashes.** On terminals
  that don't answer the cursor-position query (DSR) quickly during a resize — tmux, some
  SSH sessions, and others — the inline live region could not be located after the terminal
  reflowed, so earlier surgical-clear attempts either **stranded a staircase of old
  `N% context used` + divider rows**, or (when left to ratatui's auto-resize) crashed with
  `Error: The cursor position could not be read within a normal duration`.

  Since surgical clearing is impossible without a working DSR, the resize path now does a
  **DSR-free full-screen wipe** (`ClearType::All`) before rebuilding the region fresh —
  exactly one copy of the chrome can ever exist and the reflow position never matters.
  Validated against a DSR-dropping pane across widen / narrow / rapid-resize bursts: no
  duplicate, no crash.

  Trade-off: the on-screen transcript is cleared on resize (it repaints from the live region
  down). The finalized conversation still lives in the terminal's scrollback history and the
  in-app transcript viewer — only the on-screen copy is redrawn.

## [1.0.32] — displays as `v1.0.032`

### Fixed

- **TUI resize duplication — corrected anchor.** v1.0.31's fix anchored the inline-region
  clear to the *bottom* of the screen, which is only right when the region is pinned to the
  bottom (a screen full of transcript). In a fresh / near-empty session the live region sits
  high on the screen with blank space below it, so the bottom-anchored clear wiped empty rows
  and left the real composer/status untouched — the duplicate persisted. The clear now homes
  to the region's **actual tracked top** (`last_inline_top`, captured at startup and every
  rebuild), clamped into the resized screen, so it erases the on-screen chrome whether it sits
  high (empty session) or low (full screen); the rebuild re-anchors the fresh region at the
  same row, leaving exactly one copy.

## [1.0.31] — displays as `v1.0.031`

### Added — post-edit format + diagnostics loop (stop editing blind)

- **OSA no longer edits code blind.** After every `file_edit` / `multi_file_edit` /
  `file_write` / `file_create`, the touched file is run through a fast, single-file
  **format + diagnostics** pass and any syntax/parse error is injected back into the tool
  result the **same turn** — so the model sees the mistake it just made instead of
  discovering it 20 tool-calls later. This was the top convergent gap versus Claude Code,
  Codex, OpenCode and Grok (`docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md` G1 + G2).
  - **Auto-format on write** — Elixir formats **in-process** via `Code.format_string!/2`
    (respecting `.formatter.exs` opts, no `mix` startup cost); Go/Rust/JS·TS/Python use
    their single-file formatter (`gofmt -w`, `rustfmt`, `prettier --write`, `ruff format`).
  - **Fast diagnostics** — Elixir syntax via `Code.string_to_quoted/2` (instant, in-process);
    Go via `gofmt -e`, Rust via `rustfmt`, JS via `node --check`, Python via `ruff check` /
    `py_compile`; TS/TSX parse errors surface through `prettier`.
  - Dependency-light and **degrades to a no-op** when a tool binary is absent; each command
    is time-boxed; a file that fails to parse is left byte-for-byte untouched and its error
    reported. Wired via the pluggable `:diagnostics_provider` seam; disable with
    `config :optimal_system_agent, post_edit_verify: [enabled: false]`.

### Fixed

- **TUI — resizing no longer duplicates the composer/status bar.** The inline-region rebuild
  cleared old chrome anchored to a `crossterm::cursor::position()` **DSR query**, which tmux
  and some emulators drop or answer with a stale row during a resize burst (a pane drag fires
  many `Resize` events) — stranding a duplicate composer while a fresh one drew below. The
  clear now anchors to the bottom-anchored region geometry derived from
  `crossterm::terminal::size()` (an ioctl reflecting the applied resize, no escape round-trip
  to drop): deterministic for grow/width-only changes, exact for shrink.

## [1.0.30] — displays as `v1.0.030`

### Fixed / robustness

- **A port conflict no longer crashes the whole app.** When `OSA_HTTP_PORT` (default 9089)
  was already in use, OSA hard-crashed on boot — Bandit failed to bind, the supervisor
  restarted it 10×/60s, and the entire OTP tree died with a cryptic dump. Now a boot
  **preflight** halts cleanly with an actionable message that distinguishes *another OSA
  instance already running* ("connect to it, or set `OSA_HTTP_PORT`") from *a foreign
  process holding the port* ("free it — `ss -ltnp | grep 9089` — or set `OSA_HTTP_PORT`"). A
  single shared `Net.Port` helper backs every surface below.
- **`osa doctor`** now reports three distinct states — OSA responding, OSA not running, and
  **port taken by a non-OSA process** (the case it previously misdiagnosed as "API not
  responding"). It also reads `OLLAMA_URL` (was `OLLAMA_HOST`, misaligned with the app).
- **Onboarding** warns if the HTTP port is already taken *before* you finish setup, instead
  of completing "successfully" and then crashing on first launch.
- **TUI** — the "backend unreachable" message now names the port and points at `osa doctor`
  instead of a vague dead-end.

## [1.0.29] — displays as `v1.0.029`

### Fixed

- **Context meter read far too high on Ollama Cloud models.** For a `:cloud` model running
  through the `:ollama` provider (e.g. `glm-5.2:cloud`), the usage denominator collapsed to
  the local Ollama KV-cache ceiling (`ollama_num_ctx`, ~32k → ~12.7k after the reserve)
  instead of the model's real context window (1,000,000) — so a normal ~15k-token turn read
  **over 100%** and the bar filled almost instantly. `effective_context_window/2` now skips
  the local KV cap for `:cloud` models, so the meter (and context budgeting + `num_ctx`
  sizing, one source of truth) use the true window. A ~50k-token session now reads ~5%
  instead of pinned-full.

## [1.0.28] — displays as `v1.0.028`

This cycle built an agent **fleet**: a Claude-Code-parity roster of full-power
sub-agents, dynamic multi-agent **workflows**, a renamed **effort ladder** that
gates them, and — the capstone — **self-orchestration** so OSA can decompose a
task into disjoint file-owned workstreams, fan out a collision-free wave in
isolated worktrees, verify it, and commit itself. See `docs/FLEETVIEW_DESIGN.md`,
`docs/FLEET_ORCHESTRATION.md`, and `docs/FLEET_EDGE_CASES.md`.

### Agent Fleet

- **FleetView roster** — a live, arrow-selectable panel under the composer: a
  green never-killable `main` root row plus one row per running node (agent-type,
  live activity, elapsed, `↓ tokens`). `←` browses, ↑/↓ select, Enter attaches a
  read-view of a node's stream, `x` stops it. Inline roster is bounded to 8 rows
  (`+K more`); the `/agents` dashboard lists all.
- **Full-power spawn** (`Fleet.spawn_fleet_node`) — each node is a complete OSA
  loop (full tools/MCP/memory/permissions) on its own session with its own
  custom-agent system prompt + tool allowlist, joined to the run tree. Not the
  restricted delegate path.
- **`fleet` tool** — the model auto-invokes it (`action: spawn | workflow`);
  spawning is automatic, `/fg` and `←` are optional viewing. Depth- and
  fleet-cap-guarded (spawn-bomb safe).
- **Dynamic workflows** (`Fleet.fan_out`) — fan out one full-power node per item
  through a 16-concurrent bounded pool with FIFO queue-drain, a 1000-node
  run-lifetime kill switch, and a live `N/16` roster counter. Per-node timeout,
  per-item error isolation, and a whole-tree budget guard that stops spawning when
  the fleet budget is exhausted. Nodes coordinate through the shared scratchpad.

### Effort

- **Ladder renamed** to `fast / medium / high / xhigh / ultra` (was
  `low/medium/high/max`), with a back-compat normalizer so persisted `:low`/`:max`
  settings keep working. Effort = how much it thinks; the current tier is shown
  live in the thinking indicator (e.g. *"thinking harder with ultra effort"*).
- **`ultra`** is the max tier and the gate for dynamic workflows. Effort drives the
  provider thinking budget across Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini / Ollama (verified
  matrix); opus honors an explicit max budget at `ultra` instead of always adaptive.

### Self-orchestration

- **Worktree-per-node isolation** (`isolation: :worktree`) so parallel nodes edit
  their own worktrees and never collide.
- **`Fleet.Finalizer`** — merges disjoint node diffs, runs an authoritative gate,
  and commits when green (scoped `git add -- <file>`, attribution-clean, never pushes).
- **The loop is closed end-to-end** — `fan_out` waits for each node to complete before
  capturing its worktree diff (so the finalizer merges *real* changes), and the `fleet`
  tool exposes `isolation` + `finalize` (gate + commit) so the coordinator can run the
  whole recon → isolate → merge → gate → commit flow. (Unit-verified end to end; a
  live-repo integration test is the next follow-up.)
- **Fleet Orchestration playbook** (`priv/skills/fleet-orchestration`) — teaches the
  coordinator the disjoint-workstream method: recon → partition by file ownership →
  isolate → structured reports → finalize → checkpoint.

### Durability & recovery

- **Budget survives restart** — the `max_budget_usd` cap is persisted in the
  checkpoint and restored, so a crash can no longer reset it to zero.
- **Crash recovery** — stale `:running` rows are reconciled at boot; an opt-in
  resumer re-dispatches orphaned autonomous runs.

### Hardening

- Fleet edge cases across `fan_out` (timeout / error isolation / empty-huge items),
  fleet-tool argument validation, and scratchpad concurrency (cluster-serialized
  writes). Two provider thinking bugs fixed (OpenAI silently disabling reasoning on
  a bad effort value; Gemini `nil > 0` term-ordering emitting a bogus budget).
  FleetView keyboard navigation verified end-to-end. **TUI resize no longer duplicates
  content** — the inline-viewport clear now anchors to the actual cursor instead of
  ratatui's stale pre-resize geometry, which had been scrolling old chrome into
  scrollback on every resize. Intermittently-flaky tests stabilized at the root cause
  (session-scoped event capture; `async: false` where global app-env is shared). Full
  suite: 5116 tests, 0 failures.

## [1.0.10] — displays as `v1.0.010`

This cycle closed out the CC-parity backlog: 16 workstreams across the agent
loop, memory, delegation, tools, ops, and the Rust TUI. Grouped by area
below; see `docs/BACKLOG.md` for the item-by-item scoreboard and commit
references.

### Agent

- **Investigative plan mode** — `enter_plan_mode` / `exit_plan_mode` tools
  route through `Agent.Loop.enter_plan_mode/1`, gating the session to
  read-only tools until the plan is exited. The plan text is a **durable
  file** (`~/.osa/sessions/<id>.plan.md`, next to the progress ledger) rather
  than transient state, so a plan survives context resets, restarts, and the
  approve/reject/edit round-trip.
- **Goal-level verifier** (`Agent.Loop.GoalVerifier`) — an independent,
  read-only skeptic panel (N subagents, majority-refute vote) that judges
  whether the user's *goal* was met, not just whether a file compiles. Off by
  default; fail-closed to `:incomplete` on ties or missing data. Run-capped
  and stall-gated so it never spins forever.
- **Multi-turn goal orchestration** (`Agent.Loop.GoalTracker`) — a
  cross-turn, ETS-backed status machine (`:active | :paused | :completed |
  :off_track`) that survives across top-level turns. Auto-pauses on a
  cross-turn stall (two verification rounds citing the same gap) or a
  lifetime run cap, and gates the (expensive) verifier panel on a reverify
  cadence instead of every turn.
- **Reasoning-only doomloop detector** (`Agent.Loop.DoomLoop.ReasoningOnly`) —
  catches a model spinning in pure thought (zero tool calls) or repeatedly
  erroring, which the existing tool-call-keyed detectors can't see. Halts
  after a small consecutive-streak threshold and forwards to the existing
  `Resample` remedy.
- **Forced max-steps wrap-up** — hitting the iteration cap now triggers one
  final tools-disabled model turn that writes a real state summary/handoff
  instead of a canned line. Guarded so hitting the cap can never crash the
  turn.
- **Header-aware retry** — provider resilience honors a `Retry-After` header
  from the provider (capped at 60s) instead of blind exponential backoff,
  and can rebuild the HTTP/1.1 client / strip images on a header-driven
  retry decision.
- **First-failure self-correction** — the verification gate is *grounded*:
  it re-prompts only after an external check (build/test/lint) actually
  fails, following the CRITIC / "LLMs Cannot Self-Correct" research —
  ungrounded self-judgment is avoided.
- **Token-budget "work to target"** — `target_output_tokens` (state or app
  env) keeps the loop auto-continuing until a caller-specified output-token
  budget is met, capped at a small number of continues.

### Context / Memory

- **Hybrid RAG recall** — vector KNN (`Memory.Search`, cosine similarity)
  fused with MMR diversity re-ranking (`Memory.MMR`) and dependency-free
  query expansion (`Memory.QueryExpansion`, synonym table + stemming) for
  the lexical scoring path. Degrades gracefully to keyword-only scoring when
  no embedding provider is configured or a call fails.
- **Persisted vector store** — embeddings are now durably stored one row per
  memory id in a `memory_vectors` table in the same SQLite database the
  memory store uses, with an ETS warm-read cache in front. Content-hash
  invalidation re-embeds on content drift.
- **Compaction quality**:
  - Verbatim latest-user-query preservation — the most recent `user` message
    is wrapped in `<user_query>` tags and prepended to any generated
    summary, untouched by the summarizing LLM.
  - Token-budgeted, turn-aware tail selection — `preserve_recent_budget`
    (25% of the usable context window, clamped `[2_000, 8_000]`,
    operator-overridable) replaces a fixed message-count tail.
  - Prune tier — a non-LLM pass that erases old (out-of-budget) tool-result
    output outright rather than summarizing it, with a protected-tools
    allowlist and a minimum-reclaim gate before it bothers mutating anything.
  - Media-strip + overflow replay — on context-overflow retries, media
    blocks are stripped from messages before retrying, up to 3 overflow
    retries.
- **Post-compaction auto-continue** — after a compaction pass changes the
  message list, the loop can auto-continue the turn (gated by
  `ProactiveCompaction.continuation_enabled?/0`) instead of silently
  returning a truncated response.

### Delegation

- **Transitive cascading cancel** — `Loop.cancel/1` now BFS-walks the
  parent/child session tree and cancels every descendant sub-agent, plus
  batch-kills their background shell commands in one pass
  (`BackgroundManager.cancel_for_sessions/1`).
- **`task_wait` join-barrier depth ceiling** — a blocking wait on other
  agents' completion can no longer nest arbitrarily deep; `max_depth/0`
  (default 3, `:max_blocking_wait_depth`) is checked before a wait starts,
  denying requests that would exceed the ceiling instead of blocking and
  failing later.
- **Peer-resume (sibling handoff)** — a sub-agent run can be seeded from a
  sibling/peer's accumulated context (`resumed_from`) rather than starting
  fresh or forking from the parent; surfaced in run metadata for lineage.
- **Worktree durable snapshot** — `FastWorktree.snapshot_ref/2` commits any
  uncommitted worktree changes and writes a durable git ref
  (`refs/osa/subagent-snapshots/...` by default) before teardown, so a
  sub-agent's work stays inspectable/resumable without being merged or lost.

### Tools

- **Hashline drift-guard edits** (`FileEdit.DriftGuard`) — a second,
  independent content-hash guard on top of `FileState`'s `{mtime, size}`
  check, closing the blind spot where two different file states collide on
  the same size within the same wall-clock second. Only ever *stricter* than
  the existing guard; never blocks a legitimate re-read/edit cycle.
- **Output-shorten-to-file** (`Agent.Loop.ToolResultStorage`) — tool results
  over 50KB or 2,000 lines are persisted to `~/.osa/tool-results/<id>.txt`
  and replaced inline with a head/tail preview (40/20 lines) plus a file
  reference, preventing context bloat from huge shell/grep output.

### Ops

- **Rollback-safe self-update** (`osa update`, `bin/osa-update`) — dual
  symlink (`current` / `previous`) atomic swap: stage a fresh git-worktree
  checkout, build it, boot-probe its `/health` endpoint, and only then
  atomically repoint `current`. A post-swap health re-check auto-rolls-back
  to `previous` on failure. `osa update --staged`, `osa update --rollback`,
  and `--dry-run` are all supported; nothing is mutated on a dry run or a
  failed build/health gate.

### TUI

- **Composer** — structured `@`-mentions (file/dir/agent, with a per-kind
  glyph in the popup), ghost-text completion, `!`-prefixed bash submit mode,
  a huge-input pill for large pastes, and frecency-ranked mention recall.
- **Render** — LaTeX-to-Unicode conversion, richer table-cell markdown
  (nested quotes, tabs, soft breaks), bold-italic/setext heading support,
  and a raw-source toggle (`alt+r`).
- **Notifications / focus / clipboard** — terminal focus tracking (DECSET
  1004), OSC 9;4 progress reporting, a sleep inhibitor during long runs, an
  audio completion cue, kitty click-to-focus, a layered clipboard, and a
  configurable notification channel (`OSA_NOTIFY_CHANNEL`, opt-out via
  `OSA_NO_NOTIFY`).
- **Status / activity** — esc-again-to-interrupt, a watcher/background cue,
  a queued-message hint, usage-percent + low-balance indicator, an MCP
  status chip, width-gated spinner, and a subagent footer.
- **Fixed-height streaming viewport** — the inline chat viewport now holds a
  constant height while streaming instead of reflowing the terminal on every
  chunk.

### Deferred (documented, not dropped)

See `docs/BACKLOG.md` → "Deferred with rationale" for the reasoning behind
message-derived loop state (crash-resume), structured `@file`/`@agent` refs
on the wire, and the remaining crossterm-blocked mouse items.

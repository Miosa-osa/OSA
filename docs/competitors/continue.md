## Overview

## Key Features

- Chat, Plan (read-only sandbox), Agent (autonomous multi-file) modes

- `.continue/rules/` for team config sharing
- MCP tool support
- Deployable: cloud, on-premise, air-gapped
- Tab autocomplete

## What They Have That We Don't

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| JetBrains support | LOW | Second IDE platform |
| Air-gapped deployment | LOW | Enterprise security requirement |
| Team config sharing | MEDIUM | `.continue/rules/` equivalent |

## What We Have That They Don't

Everything multi-agent, memory, learning, channels, scheduling, hooks, budget, sandboxing, Signal Theory. They are an IDE assistant, not an autonomous agent.

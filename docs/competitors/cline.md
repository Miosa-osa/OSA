## What They Have That We Don't

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| VS Code integration | HIGH | IDE experience |
| Browser automation (Computer Use) | HIGH | Visual debugging, form filling |
| Per-step human approval | MEDIUM | Safety model |
| Timeline/rollback | MEDIUM | Change tracking UI |

## What We Have That They Don't

| Feature | Our Advantage |
|---------|---------------|
| Multi-agent orchestration | Single-agent only |
| Persistent memory & learning | No memory between sessions |
| Signal Theory | No message intelligence |
| 12+ messaging channels | VS Code-only |
| Swarm patterns | No parallel execution |
| OTP fault tolerance | Resource-heavy in VS Code |
| Budget/cost management | No cost tracking |
| Scheduling & automation | No autonomous behavior |
| Sandboxing | No isolation |
| CLI + HTTP API | IDE-locked |

> Threat Level: **LOW** | Proprietary | Cloud-only | ~$500/mo

## Overview

Commercial autonomous AI software engineer. First to market with "full engineer" positioning. Cloud-based. Not open-source.

## Key Features

- Complete toolkit: code editor, shell, web browser, full internet access
- Multi-step engineering without supervision
- **Devin Wiki**: auto-generated documentation
- **Devin Search**: interactive code Q&A
- End-to-end testing via computer use
- Multiple parallel instances
- Slack, Linear, Jira, GitHub, GitLab integration

## What They Have That We Don't

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Auto-generated documentation (Wiki) | MEDIUM | Nice productivity feature |
| Code Q&A engine (Search) | MEDIUM | Interactive code understanding |
| Project management integration (Jira/Linear) | LOW | Enterprise workflows |
| End-to-end testing via computer use | MEDIUM | Full UI testing |

## What We Have That They Don't

| Feature | Our Advantage |
|---------|---------------|
| Open source | Closed, proprietary |
| Local-first / self-hosted | Cloud-only, privacy concerns |
| Free | $500/mo per seat |
| 18 LLM providers | Proprietary models only |
| Full architecture transparency | Black box |
| 12+ messaging channels | Slack integration only |
| OTP fault tolerance | Unknown internals |
| Persistent learning (SICA) | No learning |
| Signal Theory | Nothing |

## Assessment

Expensive, closed, cloud-only. The "AI engineer" positioning is compelling marketing but the product has quality issues on complex real-world tasks. We win on openness, cost, and architecture.

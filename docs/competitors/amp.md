# Amp (by Sourcegraph)

> Threat Level: **LOW** | Proprietary | TypeScript

## Overview

Coding agent for teams by Sourcegraph. Deep code intelligence. Sub-agents (Oracle for code analysis, Librarian for external libraries). No token constraints.

## Key Features

- **Deep mode**: autonomous research using extended reasoning
- Sub-agents: Oracle (code analysis), Librarian (library analysis)
- AGENT.md project files
- Dynamic thinking budget
- VS Code, JetBrains (CLI), Neovim, terminal support
- Free tier (ad-supported, up to $10/day)

## What They Have That We Don't

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Sourcegraph code intelligence | MEDIUM | Deep codebase understanding |
| Dynamic thinking budget | LOW | Auto-adjust reasoning depth |
| Multi-IDE + terminal support | MEDIUM | Broad IDE coverage |

## What We Have That They Don't

Everything except code intelligence integration. Proprietary, primarily Claude-powered, no self-hosting, no memory/learning, limited multi-agent.
